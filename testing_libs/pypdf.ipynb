The competition is contested by UEFA\\nmembers\\' senior men\\'s national teams, determining the continental champion of Europe.[4][5] It is\\nthe second-most watched football tournament in the world after the FIFA World Cup; the Euro\\n2016 final was watched by a global audience of around 600 million.[6] The competition has been\\nheld every four years since 1960 ,[7][8][9] except for 2020 , when it was postpone d until 2021 due\\nto the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, but kept the name Euro 2020. Scheduled to be in the\\neven-numbered year between FIFA World Cup tournaments, it was originally called the\\nEuropean Nations\\' Cup before changing to its current name in 1968 . Since 1996, the\\nindividual events have been branded as \"UEFA Euro [year]\".\\nBefore entering the tournament, all teams other than the host nations (which qualify\\nautomatically) compete in a qualifying process. Until 2016, the championship winners could\\ncompete in the following year\\'s FIFA Confederations Cup, but were not obliged to do so.[10]\\nFrom the 2020 edition onwards, the winner competes in the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of\\nChampions.\\nThe sixteen European Championship tournaments have been won by ten national teams:\\nGermany and Spain have each won three titles, Italy and France have won two titles, and the\\nSoviet Union, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece and Portugal have won one\\ntitle each. To date, Spain is the only team to have won consecutive titles, doing so in 2008 and\\n2012.\\nThe most recent championship, held across Europe in 2021 (postpone d from 2020 due to the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic), was won by Italy, who lifted their second European title after beating\\nEngland in the final at Wembley Stadium in London  on penalties.[11][12]\\nRegional tournaments for national teams existed before the advent of a truly pan-European\\ncompetition. Starting in 1883, the British Home Championship was an annua l competition\\ncontested between the United Kingdom \\'s four national teams, England, Scotland, Wales, and\\nIreland. Until these national teams entered the FIFA World Cup in 1950 , it was the most\\nimportant international tournament these nations competed in. Similarly, from 1927 until 1960,\\nthe Central European International Cup was held six times. It brought  together the national teams\\nof Austria, Hunga ry, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, and Yugoslavia. The idea for a pan-\\nEuropean football tournament was first proposed by the French Football Federation\\'s secretary-\\ngeneral Henri Delaunay in 1927, but it was not until 1958 that the tournament was started, three\\nyears after Delaunay\\'s death.[13] In honou r of Delaunay, the trophy awarded to the champions is named after him.[14] The 1960\\ntournament, held in France, had four teams competing in the finals out of 17 that entered the competition.[15] It was won by the Soviet\\nUnion, beating Yugos lavia 2–1 in a tense final in Paris.[16] Spain withdrew from its quarter-final match against the Soviet Union because\\nof two political protests.[17] Of the 17 teams that entered the qualifying tournament, notable absentees were England, the Netherlands,\\nWest Germany and Italy.[18]\\nSpain held the next tournament in 1964 , which saw an increase in entries to the qualification tournament, with 29 entering;[19] West\\nGermany was a notable absentee once again and Greece withdrew after being drawn against Albania, with whom they were still at\\nwar.[20] The hosts beat the title holders, the Soviet Union, 2–1 a t the Santiago B ernabéu Stadium in Madrid.[21]\\nThe tournament format stayed the same for the 1968 tournament, hosted and won by Italy.[22][23] For the first and only time, a match was\\ndecided on a coin toss (the semi-final between Italy and the Soviet Union)[24] and the final went to a replay, after the match against\\nYugoslavia finished 1–1.[25] Italy won the replay 2–0.[26] More teams entered this tournament (31), a testament to its burgeoningHistory\\nBeginnings\\n\\nRuud Gullit and the Netherlands\\nteam celebrating their victory in 1988popul arity.[27]\\nBelgium hosted the 1972 tournament, which West Germany won, beating the Soviet Union 3–0 in the final, with goals coming from\\nGerd Müller (twice) and Herbert Wimmer at the Heysel Stadium in Brussels.[28] This tournament would provide a taste of things to come,\\nas the German side contained many of  the key members of the 1974 F IFA World Cup-winning team.[29][30]\\nThe 1976 tournament in Yugoslavia was the last in which only four teams took part in the final tournament, and the last in which the hosts\\nhad to qualify. Czechoslovakia beat West Germany in the newly introduc ed penalty shootout. After seven successful conve rsions, Uli\\nHoeneß missed, leaving Czechoslovakian Antonín Panenka with the oppor tunity to score and win the tournament. An \"audacious\"\\nchipped shot,[31] described by UEFA as \"perhaps the most famous spot kick of all time\" secured the victory as Czechoslovakia won 5–3\\non pe nalties.[32]\\nThe competition was expanded to eight teams in the 1980 tournament, again hosted by Italy. It involved a group stage, with the winners\\nof the groups  going on to contest the final, and the runne rs-up playing in the third place play-off.[33] West Germany won their second\\nEuropean title by beating Belgium 2–1, with two goals scored by Horst Hrubesch at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome.[34] Horst Hrubesch\\nscored early in the first half before René Vandereycken equalised for Belgium with a penalty in the second half. With two minutes\\nremaining, H rubesch headed the winner for West Germany from a Karl-Heinz Rummenigge corner.[35]\\nFrance won their first major title at home in the 1984 tournament, with their captain Michel Platini scoring 9 goals in just 5 games,\\nincluding the opening goal in the final, in which they beat Spain 2–0.[36][37] The format also changed, with the top two teams in each\\ngroup going through  to a semi-final stage, instead of the winners of each group going straight into the final. The third place play-off was\\nalso abolished. The losing teams from the semi-finals win the bronze medal. [38]\\nWest Germany hosted UEFA Euro 1988 , but lost 2–1 to the Netherlands, their traditional rivals,\\nin the semi-finals, which sparked vigorous celebrations in the Netherlands.[39][40] The\\nNetherlands went on to win the tournament in a rematch of their first game of the group stage,\\nbeating the Soviet Union 2–0 at the Olympia Stadion in Munich.[41] Marco van Basten scored the\\nsecond goal, a volley over the keeper from the right wing which is often considered one of the\\nbest goals ever scored.[42]\\nUEFA Euro 1992  was held in Sweden, and was won by Denmark, who were only in the finals\\nafter UN sanctions prevented Yugoslavia\\'s participation as some of the states constituting the\\nSocialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia were at war with each other.[43][44] The Danes beat\\nholders the Netherlands on penalties in the semi-finals,[45] then defeated world champion\\nGermany 2–0.[46] This was the first tournament in which a unified Germany took part and also the first major tournament to have the\\nplayers\\' names printed on t heir backs.\\nEngland hosted UEFA Euro 1996 , the first tournament to use the nomenclature \"Euro [year]\" and would see the number of teams taking\\npart doubl e to 16.[47] The hosts, in a replay of the 1990 FIFA World Cup semi-final, were knoc ked out on penalties by Germany.[48] The\\nsurprise team of the tournament was the newly formed Czech Republic, participating on its first international competition following the\\ndissolution of Czechoslovakia, which reached the final after beating Portugal and France in the knoc kout stage. Germany would go on to\\nwin the final 2–1 thanks to the first golden goal ever in a major tournament, scored by Oliver Bierhoff five minutes into extra time.[49][50]\\nThis was Germany\\'s first title as a unified nation.\\nUEFA Euro 2000  was the first tournament to be held by two countries, in the Netherlands and Belgium.[51] France, the reigning World\\nCup champions, were favoured to win, and they lived up to expectations when they beat Italy 2–1 after extra time, having come from\\nbeing 1–0 down: Sylvain Wiltord equalised in the last minute of regular time and David Trezeguet scored the winning golden goal in\\nextra time.[52]\\nUEFA Euro 2004 , like 1992, produc ed an upset: Greece, who had only qualified for one World Cup (1994 ) and one European\\nChampionship (1980 ) before, beat hosts Portugal 1–0 in the final (after having also beaten them in the opening game) with a goal scored\\nby Angelos Charisteas in the 57th minute to win a tournament that they had been given odds of 150–1  to win before it began[53] (being\\nthe second least likely team to have any success after Latvia). On their way to the Final, they also beat holders France[54] as well as the\\nCzech Republic with a silver goal,[55][56] a rule which replaced the previous golden goal in 2003, before being abolished itself shortly\\nafter this tournament.Expansion to 8 teams\\nExpansion to 16 teams\\n\\nThe UEFA Euro 2004 opening\\nceremony in Portugal.The 2008 tournament, hosted by Austria and Switzerland, marked the second time that two\\nnations co-hosted and the first edition where the new trophy was awarded.[57] It commenced on 7\\nJune and finished on 29 June.[58] The final between Germany and Spain was held at the Ernst\\nHappel Stadion in Vienna.[59] Spain defeated Germany 1–0, with a goal scored by Fernando\\nTorres in the 33rd minute, sparking much celebration across the country.[60] This was their first\\ntitle since the 1964 tournament. Spain were the highest scoring team with 12 goals scored and\\nDavid Villa finished as the top scorer with four goals. Xavi was awarded the player of the\\ntournament, and ni ne Spanish players were picked for the team of the tournament.\\nThe UEFA Euro 2012  tournament was co-hosted by Poland and Ukraine.[61] Spain defeated Italy\\n4–0 in the Final, thus becoming the first nation to defend a European Championship title, as well\\nas the first European team to win three consecutive major tournaments.[62] In scoring the third\\ngoal of the final, Torres became the first player to score in two European Championship finals. He was equal top scorer for the\\ntournament with three goals in total, along with Mario Balotelli, Alan Dzagoev, Mario Gómez, Mario Mandžukić, and Cristiano Ronaldo,\\ndespite only being used as a substitute player. The tournament was otherwise notable for having the most headed goals in a Euro\\ntournament (26 out of 76 goals in total); a disallowed goal in the England versus Ukraine group game which replays showed had crossed\\nthe goal line, and which prompted President of FIFA Sepp Blatter to tweet, \"GLT (Goal-line technology) is no longe r an alternative but a\\nnecessity\",[63] thus reversing hi s long-held reluctance to embrace such technology; and some crowd violence in group ga mes.\\nIn 2007, the Football Association of Ireland and Scottish Football Association proposed the expansion of the tournament, which was later\\nconfirmed by the UEFA Executive Committee in September 2008.[64][65] Out of the 54 member associations of UEFA, only three,\\nincluding England and Germany, oppos ed the expansion.[66] On 28 May 2010, UEFA announc ed that UEFA Euro 2016  would be\\nhosted by France. France beat bids of Turkey (7–6 in voting in the second voting round)  and Italy, which had the fewest votes in the first\\nvoting round.[67] Euro 2016 was the first to have 24 teams in the finals.[68] This was the third time France have hosted the competition.\\nPortugal, which qualified for the knoc k-out phase despite finishing third in its group, went on to win the championship by defeating\\nheavily favoured host team France 1–0 in the Final, thanks to a goal from Eder in the 109th minute. Cristiano Ronaldo, Portugal\\'s world-\\nrenowned striker, came out of the game due to injury in the 25th minute. This was the first time Portugal won a major tournament.\\nFor the 2020 tournament, three bids were proposed, including a bid from Turkey,[69] a joint bid from the Republic of Ireland, Scotland\\nand Wales,[70] and a joint bid from Georgia and Azerbaijan.[71] In December 2012, however, UEFA announc ed that the 2020 tournament\\nwould be hosted in several cities in various countries across Europe, with the semi-finals and final being played in London.[72][73] The\\nvenues were selected and announc ed by UEFA on 19 September 2014.[74] However, Brussels was removed as a host city on 7\\nDecember 2017 due to delays with the building of the Eurostadium.[75] On 17 March 2020,  UEFA announc ed that Euro 2020 would be\\ndelayed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, and proposed it take place from 11 June to 11 July 2021. The competition\\nwas postpone d in order to reduce pressure on the public services in affected countries and to provide space in the calendar for the\\ncompletion of domestic leagues that had been suspended.[76] Before the Euro 2020, Dublin was also removed as one of the host cities\\ndue to its inability to guarantee spectators to the stadium, while Bilbao was replaced by Seville for the same reason.[77][78] In the Final,\\nItaly defeated maiden finalists England 3–2 on penalties, after the game was tied 1–1 after extra time, to win their second European\\nChampionship.[79]\\nThe Henri Delaunay Trophy , which is awarded to the winner of the European Championship,[80] is named in honour  of Henri Delaunay,\\nthe first General Secretary of UEFA, who came up with the idea of a European championship but died five years before the first\\ntournament in 1960. His son Pierre was in charge of creating the trophy .[81] Since the first tournament it has been awarded to the winning\\nteam for them to keep for four years, until the next tournament. This trophy bore the words Coupe  d\\'Europe (\"European Cup\"), Coupe\\nHenri Delaunay  (\"Henri Delaunay Cup\"), and Championnat  d\\'Europe (\"European Championship\") on the front and a juggling boy on\\nthe back.\\nFor the 2008 tournament, the Henri Delaunay Trophy was remodelled to make it larger, as the old trophy was overshadowed by UEFA\\'s\\nother trophies such as the new European Champion Clubs\\' Cup. The new trophy , which is made of sterling silver, now weighs 8\\nkilograms (18 lb) and is 60 centimetres (24 in) tall, being 2 kilograms (4.4 lb) heavier and 18 centimetres (7.1 in) longe r than the old one.\\nThe marble plinth that was serving as base was removed. The new silver base of the trophy had to be enlarged to make it stable. The\\nnames of the winning countries that had appeared on the plaques glued to the plinth are now engraved on the back of the trophy ,[82]\\nunde r the word Coupe  Henri Delaunay  and are written in English rather than French its predecessor had. The 1972 and 1980 winning\\ncountry, West Germany, is written as just Germany. Since 2016, t he juggling boy w as returned on t he trophy\\' s back.Expansion to 24 teams\\nTrophy\\n\\nThe trophy on display in 2021The players and coaches of the winning team and the runne r-up team are awarded gold and silver\\nmedals, respectively. Each association that competes in the final tournament receives a\\ncommemorative plaque. Each time the team losing semi-finalist, as well as each finalist, receive a\\ndedicated plaque. Though there is no longe r a third place play-off, UEFA decided in the 2008 edition\\nto award the semi-final losers (Turkey and Russia) bronze medals for the first time,[83] and did the\\nsame in the 2012 edition when Germany and Portugal received bronze medals.[84] However, UEFA\\ndecided that losing semi-finalists would no longe r receive medals from the 2016 edition onwards.[85]\\nBronze medals were previously awarded for winners of the third place play-off, the last of which\\nwas held in 1980.[86]\\nBefore 1980, only four teams qualified for the final tournament. From 1980, eight teams competed.\\nIn 1996 the tournament expanded to 16 teams, since it was easier for European nations to qualify for\\nthe World Cup than their own continental championship; 14 of the 24 teams at the 1982 , 1986  and\\n1990  World Cups had been European, whereas the European Championship finals still involved\\nonly eight teams.\\nIn 2007, there was much discussion about an expansion of the tournament to 24 teams, started by\\nScotland and the Republic of Ireland, due to the increased number of football associations in Europe\\nafter the break-ups of Czechoslovakia, Yugos lavia and the Soviet Union, and the inclusion of Israel and Kazakhstan. The new president\\nof UEFA, Michel Platini, was reported to be in favour of expansion which proved an accurate assumption. Whilst on 17 April 2007,\\nUEFA\\'s executive committee formally decided against expansion in 2012, Platini indicated in June 2008 that UEFA will increase\\nparticipation from 16 to 24 teams in future tournaments, starting from 2016.[87] On 25 September, it was announc ed by Franz\\nBeckenbauer that an agreement had been reached, and the expansion to 24 t eams would be officially announc ed the next day.[88]\\nThe competing teams are chosen by a series of qualifying games: in 1960  and 1964  through home and away play-offs; from 1968\\nthrough a combination of both qualifying groups  and play-off games. The host country was selected from the four finalists after they were\\ndetermined through qua lifying.\\nSince the expansion of the final tournament starting from 1980 , the host country, or countries, have been chosen beforehand and qualify\\nautomatically.\\nIn most tournaments, the tournament consists of a round- robin group s tage followed by a  single-elimination knoc kout stage.Format\\nThe competition\\n\\nYear TeamsMatches\\nFormat\\nMin.Act.\\n1960 4 4\\nsemi-finals, 3rd-place match, final1964 4 4\\n1968 4 4 5\\n1972 4 4\\n1976 4 4\\n1980 8 14 2 groups of 4, 3rd-place match, final\\n1984 8 15\\n2 groups of 4, semi-finals, final 1988 8 15\\n1992 8 15\\n1996 16 31\\n4 groups of 4, quarter-finals, semi-finals, final2000 16 31\\n2004 16 31\\n2008 16 31\\n2012 16 31\\n2016 24 51\\n6 groups of 4, round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals, final2020 24 51\\n2024 24 51\\n2028 24 51\\n2032 24 51\\nUp to 1968 dr aws were to be broken via a coin toss in all matches but the final, draw in final match was resolved via a replay.\\nNo third place play-off has been played since 1980.\\nTo qualify, a team must finish in one of the direct qualifying spots or win a play-off.

This is calculated by taking the total number of points won by a particular\\nteam and dividing it by the number of games played, i.e. points per game. In the case of a team having hosted one of the two previous\\ncompetitions and therefore having qualified automatically, only the results from the single most recent qualifying competition are used. If\\ntwo teams have equal points per game, the committee then bases their positions in the rankings on:\\n1. Coefficient from the matches played in its most recent qualifying competition.\\n2. Average goal difference.\\n3. Average number of goals scored.\\n4. Average number of away goals scored.\\n5. Drawing of lots.\\nThe qualifying phase is played in a group format, the composition of the groups  is determined through means of a draw of teams from\\npre-defined seeded bow ls. The draw takes place after the preceding W orld Cup\\'s qualifying competition. F or UEFA Euro 2020 , the group\\nqualifying pha se consisted of ten groups; five of six teams and the remainder of five teams each.\\nEach group is played in a league format with teams playing each other home and away. The top two teams then qualified for the final\\ntournament, with remaining places decided by playoffs depending on their ranking in the UEFA Nations League. As with most leagues,\\nthe points are awarded as three for a win, one for a draw, and none  for a loss. In the eventuality of one or more teams having equal points\\nafter all matches have been played, the following criteria are used to distinguish the sides:\\n1. Higher number of points obtained in the group matches played among the teams in question.\\n2. Superior goal difference from the group matches played among the teams in question.\\n3. Higher number of goals scored in the group matches played among the teams in question.Qualifying\\n\\nMap of countries\\' best results. 10 countries have won, counting Germany and West\\nGermany as one4. Higher number of goals scored away from home in the group matches played among the teams in question.\\n5. Results of all group matches:\\n1. Superior goal difference\\n2. Higher number of goals scored\\n3. Higher number of goals scored away from home\\n4. Fair play conduct.\\n6. Drawing of lots.\\nSixteen teams progressed to the final tournament for\\nthe 2012 tournament. They were joint hosts Poland\\nand Ukraine, the winners and the highest ranked\\nsecond-placed team from the nine qualifying groups\\nas well as the winners of four play-off matches\\nbetween the runne rs-up of the other groups. These\\nsixteen teams were divided equally into four groups,\\nA, B, C and D, each consisting of four teams. The\\ngroups  were drawn up by the UEFA administration,\\nagain using seeding. The seeded teams being the host\\nnations, the reigning champions, should they qualify,\\nand those with the best points per game coefficients\\nover the qualifying phase of the tournament and the\\nprevious World Cup qualifying. Other finalists were\\nassigned to by means of a draw, using coefficients as\\na basis.\\nFor the 2016 tournament, the expansion to 24 teams\\nmeans that the teams will be drawn into six groups  of\\nfour, with the six group winners, six group runne rs-\\nup and the four best third-placed teams advancing to\\nthe round of 16 when it becomes a knoc kout\\ncompetition.[85]\\nThe groups  are again played in a league format, where a team plays its oppone nts once each. The same points system is used (three points\\nfor a win, one point for a draw, no points for a defeat). A schedule for the group matches will be drawn up, but the last two matches in a\\ngroup must kick off simultaneously. The winner and runne r-up of each group progress to the next round, where a knoc kout system is\\nused (the two teams play each other once, the winner progresses), this is used in all subsequent rounds  as well. The winners of theFinal tournament\\n\\nquarter-finals matches progress to the semi-finals, where the winners play in the final. If in any of the knoc kout rounds , the scores are still\\nequal after normal playing time, extra time and penalties are employed to separate the two teams. Unlike the FIFA World Cup, this\\ntournament no longe r has a third place playoff.\\nYear HostFinal Third place playoffNumber\\nof\\nteams Winners ScoreRunners-\\nupThird place ScoreFourth\\nplace\\n1960\\n  France\\nSoviet Union2–1\\n(a.e.t.)\\nYugoslavia\\n Czechoslovakia2–0\\nFrance4\\n1964\\n  Spain\\nSpain2–1\\n Soviet\\nUnion\\nHungary3–1\\n(a.e.t.)\\n Denmark4\\n1968\\n  Italy\\nItaly1–1\\n(a.e.t.)\\n2–0\\n(replay)\\nYugoslavia\\n England2–0\\n Soviet\\nUnion4\\n1972\\n  Belgium\\nWest Germany3–0\\n Soviet\\nUnion\\nBelgium2–1\\nHungary4\\n1976\\n  Yugoslavia\\nCzechoslovakia2–2\\n(a.e.t.)\\n(5–3 p)\\nWest\\nGermany\\nNetherlands3–2\\n(a.e.t.)\\nYugoslavia4\\n1980\\n  Italy\\nWest Germany2–1\\nBelgium\\nCzechoslovakia1–1 [a]\\n(9–8 p)\\n Italy 8\\nLosing semi-finalists[b]\\n1984\\n  France\\nFrance2–0\\nSpain\\n Denmark and \\n Portugal 8\\n1988\\n  West Germany\\nNetherlands2–0\\n Soviet\\nUnion\\n Italy and \\n West Germany 8\\n1992\\n  Sweden\\nDenmark2–0\\nGermany\\n Netherlands and \\n Sweden 8\\n1996\\n  England\\nGermany2–1\\n(g.g.)\\nCzech\\nRepublic\\n England and \\n France 16\\n2000\\n Belgium\\n Netherlands\\n France2–1\\n(g.g.)\\n Italy\\n Netherlands and \\n Portugal 16\\n2004\\n  Portugal\\nGreece1–0\\nPortugal\\n Czech Republic and\\n Netherlands16\\n2008\\n Austria\\n  Switzerland\\n Spain1–0\\nGermany\\n Russia and \\n Turkey 16\\n2012\\n Poland\\n Ukraine\\n Spain4–0\\nItaly\\n Germany and \\n Portugal 16\\n2016\\n  France\\nPortugal1–0\\n(a.e.t.)\\n France\\n Germany and \\n Wales 24Results\\n\\nMap of winners2020[c]\\n Europe[d]\\nItaly1–1\\n(a.e.t.)\\n(3–2 p)\\nEngland\\n Denmark and \\n Spain 24\\n2024\\n  Germany 24\\n2028\\n England\\n Northern\\nIreland\\n Republic of\\nIreland\\n Scotland\\n Wales24\\n2032\\n Italy\\n Turkey24\\nNotes\\na.
